# MSI EC Firmware Controller

## DISCLAIMER
I am Not Responsible for any damage, please see if your laptop is on the supported list at [Supported.md](doc/Supported.md)\
Values reported by mecc can be higher than the reality for fans and thermals especially with quick interval between runs\
Go to the discussion tab if the script is not working on your msi laptop or to confirm a msi laptop support instead of opening an issue

## Introduction
The MSI EC Firmware controller is a tool to get and set values of the ec firmware for fans, thermals, battery... on msi laptops\
A sample of an msi ec map is available in the doc folder [sample](doc/msi-ec-map.png)

## Motivation
The [isw](https://github.com/YoyPa/isw) repo is no longer maintained and doesn't work as expected so i have created a tool to replace it

## Installation
- See [Install.md](doc/Install.md)
